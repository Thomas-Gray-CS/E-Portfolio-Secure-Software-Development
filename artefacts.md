Object Oriented Programming - Artefacts 

On this page are a number of artefacts that I have gather from my studies of Object Oriented Programming as part of my MSc Computer Science course. These show my development relating to coding practice, UML and computing theory that aligns with OOP.


### Unit 2: UML Modelling to Support Secure System Planning

Below is a discussion on ISO/IEC 27000 and how people management techniques can ensure compliance of this.

[ISO/IEC 27000 Standards](/pdf/individuals_security.pdf)


### Unit 4: Exploring Programming Language Concepts

Below is an article regarding ReDOS and regex.

[ReDOS and Regex](/pdf/redos_regex.pdf)

Below is a program that uses regex to check postcodes and assert whether they are real or not:

```
       import re #re is a standard library for regex

# Define the regex pattern for UK postcodes 
# regex taken from UK Government Archive on postcode types
postcode_pattern = re.compile(r"^(GIR 0AA|[A-Z]{1,2}[0-9R][0-9A-Z]? [0-9][A-Z]{2})$")

# data for testing inputted, with the "DN" postcode changed to give error

postcodes = [
    "M1 1AA",
    "M60 1NW",
    "CR2 6XH",
    "DNI99 1PT",
    "W1A 1HQ",
    "EC1A 1BB"
]

# Function to validate postcodes and output Boolean for answer

def validate_postcode(postcode):
    if len(postcode) > 8:  # this ensures maximum potential input isn't exceeded, avoiding evil regex
        return False
    if postcode_pattern.match(postcode):
        return True
    else:
        return False

# Testing function to print all postcode checks

for postcode in postcodes:
    print(f"{postcode}: {validate_postcode(postcode)}")

```

### Unit 5: An Introduction to Testing

Below is a discussion regarding the relevance of Cyclomatic Complexity in modern day programming.

[Exploring the Cyclomatic Complexityâ€™s Relevance Today](/pdf/cyclomatic_complexity.pdf)


### Unit 8: Cryptography and Its Use in Operating Systems

Below is a discussion on an encryption algorithm, and whether it is effective.

[Cryptography Programming Exercise](/pdf/encryption_algorithm.pdf)

Below is my initial post on a discussion regarding TrueCrypt.

[Collaborative Discussion Initial Post](/pdf/truecrypt_initial.pdf)


### Unit 9: Developing an API for a Distributed Environment

Below is a response I provided to another student in reference to the work in Unit 8.

[Peer Response](/pdf/response_ssd.pdf)


### Unit 10: From Distributed Computing to Microarchitectures

Below is my summary post from the discussions in Unit 8 and Unit 9.

[Summary Post](/pdf/summary ssd.pdf)

### Unit 

The below artefact shows how I meet Learning Outcome 2) Design and implement programs that demonstrate appropriate use of object-oriented design principles.


### Artefact 5: Polymorphism Example

The below artefact also shows how I meet Learning Outcome 2) Design and implement programs that demonstrate appropriate use of object-oriented design principles.

```
    class SteerLeft:
        def __init__(self, direction, degrees):
            self.direction = direction 
            self.degrees = degrees
    
        def info(self):
            print(f"Turning {self.direction} for {self.degrees}.")
    
    
    
    class SteerRight:
        def __init__(self, direction, degrees):
            self.direction = direction # this has been reused from the SteerLeft class as a form of polymorphism
            self.degrees = degrees
    
        def info(self):
            print(f"Turning {self.direction} for {self.degrees}.")
        
    
    Left1 = SteerLeft("Left", 90)
    Right1 = SteerRight("Right", 90)
    
    for directional in (Left1, Right1):
        directional.info()
```

### Artefact 6: Discussion On Cyclomatic Complexity

The below artefact shows how I meet Learning Outcome 1) Appraise and critically evaluate object-oriented programming compared to other programming paradigms.
